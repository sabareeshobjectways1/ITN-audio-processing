  - Real-time waveform visualization
  - Timer display with precise timing
  - Progress bar for recording status

### 2. Advanced Navigation & Re-recording (Step 1)
- **Seek Controls**: Navigate backward/forward by 1s or 5s intervals
- **Pause/Resume**: Full pause and resume capability during recording
- **Partial Re-recording**: Ability to navigate to specific time points and continue recording
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time waveform display during recording

### 3. Listen Before Submit Feature (Step 2a)
- **Mandatory Listening**: "Submit" button remains disabled until full audio is played
- **Audio Scrubbing**: Users can scroll through audio at intervals
- **Full Playback Tracking**: System tracks if entire audio has been listened to
- **Visual Progress**: Progress bar shows playback position

### 4. Re-record Option (Step 2b)

- **Seamless Transition**: Smooth transition from playback to recording mode

### 5. Submit & Storage System (Step 3)
- **Dual Storage**: 
  - Original audio saved in `Original_French`/`Original_Spanish` folders
  - Frequency-converted audio saved in `Converted_French`/`Converted_Spanish` folders
- **JSON Metadata**: Complete metadata saved with each audio file
- **S3 Integration**: Ready for AWS S3 storage (currently using local simulation)
- **Frequency Conversion**: Automatic conversion based on device type and target frequency

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
1. **medical-asr.pug**: Enhanced Pug template with modern UI
2. **medical-recorder.js**: Advanced JavaScript audio recorder class
3. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with Bootstrap 4

### Backend API
1. **`/api/submit-medical-audio`**: Main submission endpoint
2. **`/medical-asr`**: Interface serving route
3. **Audio Analysis**: Real-time audio quality analysis
4. **Metadata Generation**: Comprehensive JSON metadata creation

### File Structure
```
medical_audio_storage/
├── Original_French/
│   ├── {speakerId}_{sentenceId}_{timestamp}_original.wav
│   └── {speakerId}_{sentenceId}_{timestamp}_metadata.json
├── Original_Spanish/
├── Converted_French/
│   ├── {speakerId}_{sentenceId}_{timestamp}_converted.wav
│   └── {speakerId}_{sentenceId}_{timestamp}_metadata.json
└── Converted_Spanish/
```

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Accessing the Tool
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:5001/medical-asr`
- The interface will load with all required fields and controls

3. **Choose Sentence**: Click on a sentence from the sample list
4. **Configure Settings**: Set device type and target frequency
5. **Record Audio**: Use Start/Pause/Resume controls as needed
6. **Navigate if Needed**: Use seek controls for partial re-recording
7. **Listen to Playback**: Must listen to full audio before submitting
8. **Submit or Re-record**: Choose final action

### 3. Quality Features
- **Real-time Analysis**: Audio quality is analyzed during processing
- **Drop Detection**: System detects and reports audio drops/issues
- **Frequency Conversion**: Automatic conversion to target frequency
- **Metadata Tracking**: Complete audit trail for each recording

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with:
```env
# AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret

S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket

# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/audioDB

# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
```

### S3 Bucket Structure
For production deployment, create S3 buckets with the following structure:
```
your-medical-bucket/
├── Original_French/
├── Original_Spanish/
├── Converted_French/
└── Converted_Spanish/
```
