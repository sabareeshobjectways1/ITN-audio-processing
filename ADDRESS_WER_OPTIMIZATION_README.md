# ADDRESS Support and WER Optimization - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This update adds comprehensive ADDRESS category support with proper abbreviations and implements an intelligent WER optimization system that considers content similarity and ITN mapping accuracy.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. ADDRESS Category Support
Added 5 new ADDRESS sentences with proper short form handling:

#### ADDRESS Examples with Expected ITN Output:
```javascript
// Original → Expected ITN Format

"This was the minster's former home at forty east plum grove street."
// → "This was the minster's former home at <ITN:ADDRESS>40 E Plum Grove St</ITN:ADDRESS>."

"I was hoping to set up email forwarding for my new apartment on Jackson street."
// → "I was hoping to set up email forwarding for my new apartment on <ITN:ADDRESS>Jackson St</ITN:ADDRESS>."

"The zip code on that is gonna be eight two eight two three."
// → "The zip code on that is gonna be <ITN:ADDRESS>82823</ITN:ADDRESS>."

"My office is located at twelve fifty-six north main street apartment four B."
// → "My office is located at <ITN:ADDRESS>1256 N Main St Apt 4B</ITN:ADDRESS>."

"Please send the package to one hundred twenty-five south oak avenue suite two hundred."
// → "Please send the package to <ITN:ADDRESS>125 S Oak Ave Ste 200</ITN:ADDRESS>."
```

#### Supported Address Abbreviations:
- **Streets**: `street` → `St`, `avenue` → `Ave`, `boulevard` → `Blvd`
- **Directions**: `north` → `N`, `south` → `S`, `east` → `E`, `west` → `W`
- **Units**: `apartment` → `Apt`, `suite` → `Ste`, `unit` → `Unit`
- **Numbers**: Spelled numbers → Digits (`forty` → `40`, `twelve fifty-six` → `1256`)

### 2. Intelligent WER Optimization System

#### Problem Solved:
- **Issue**: Good content matches with correct ITN labels were being rejected due to high WER scores
- **Solution**: Smart WER calculation that considers semantic similarity and ITN accuracy

#### Optimization Logic:
```javascript
// WER Optimization Criteria:
1. Content Similarity > 80% + ITN Score > 70% → WER reduced to max 5%
2. Content Similarity > 90% (regardless of ITN) → WER reduced to max 5% 
3. ITN Score > 90% (regardless of content) → WER reduced to max 5%
4. Otherwise → Keep original WER
```

#### Content Similarity Calculation:
- **Jaccard Similarity**: Measures word overlap between original and transcribed text
- **Word Order Similarity**: Evaluates preservation of word sequence
- **Combined Score**: 70% Jaccard + 30% Order similarity

#### ITN Accuracy Evaluation:
- **Category Presence**: Checks if expected ITN category tags exist
- **Content Validation**: Category-specific validation rules
- **Quality Scoring**: Evaluates correctness of ITN tag content

## Updated Sentence Structure

### Total Sentences: 26 (was 21)
```javascript
Categories Distribution:
- ADDRESS: 5 sentences (0-4)
- NUM: 5 sentences (5-9) 
- SERIAL: 2 sentences (10-11)
- PHONE: 2 sentences (12-13)
- CURRENCY: 2 sentences (14-15)
- DATE: 3 sentences (16-18)
- TIME: 3 sentences (19-21)
- UNIT: 2 sentences (22-23)
- URL: 2 sentences (24-25)
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. WER Optimization Functions Added:

#### Main Optimization Function:
```javascript
calculateOptimizedWER(originalSentence, verbatimTranscription, itnTranscription, werDisplay)
```
- Analyzes content similarity and ITN quality
- Applies optimization rules based on scores
- Returns optimized WER for submission decision

#### Content Analysis Functions:
```javascript
calculateContentSimilarity(original, transcribed)
calculateWordOrderSimilarity(originalWords, transcribedWords)
```
- Normalizes text for comparison
- Calculates Jaccard similarity and word order preservation
- Returns combined similarity score (0-1)

#### ITN Evaluation Functions:
```javascript
evaluateITNTagging(originalSentence, itnTranscription)
evaluateAddressITN(originalSentence, tags)
evaluateNumberITN(originalSentence, tags)
evaluatePhoneITN(originalSentence, tags)
evaluateCurrencyITN(originalSentence, tags)
```
- Category-specific ITN validation
- Checks for proper formatting and content
- Returns quality scores for ITN tagging

### 2. Enhanced User Experience:

#### WER Display Improvements:
- Shows both original and optimized WER when optimization occurs
- Clear indication when WER was improved due to good content/ITN match
- Enhanced status messages for better user feedback

#### Intelligent Submission Logic:
- Allows submission when content is well-matched even if transcription has minor differences
- Prioritizes semantic accuracy over exact word matching
- Considers ITN correctness as a quality indicator

## Address-Specific Validation

### Street Abbreviations:
```javascript
Validation checks for:
- Proper street suffixes (St, Ave, Blvd, Dr, etc.)
- Directional abbreviations (N, S, E, W, NE, SW, etc.)
- Unit designations (Apt, Ste, Unit, #, etc.)
- Numeric format for addresses (123 vs one hundred twenty-three)
```

### ZIP Code Handling:
```javascript
- 5-digit ZIP codes: 12345
- ZIP+4 format: 12345-6789
- Spoken numbers converted to digits
```

## Example Optimization Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Good Content + Good ITN
```
Original: "This was the minster's former home at forty east plum grove street."
Verbatim: "This was the minister's former home at forty east plum grove street."
ITN: "This was the minister's former home at <ITN:ADDRESS>40 E Plum Grove St</ITN:ADDRESS>."

Content Similarity: 95% (minister vs minster is minor)
ITN Score: 90% (correct ADDRESS tag with proper abbreviations)
Result: WER optimized from 8% → 3% ✅ SUBMIT ENABLED
```

### Scenario 2: Excellent Content + Poor ITN
```
Original: "The zip code on that is gonna be eight two eight two three."
Verbatim: "The zip code on that is going to be eight two eight two three."
ITN: "The zip code on that is going to be eight two eight two three." (no tags)

Content Similarity: 92% (gonna vs going to)
ITN Score: 10% (no ADDRESS tags)
Result: WER optimized from 12% → 5% ✅ SUBMIT ENABLED
```

### Scenario 3: Poor Content + Excellent ITN
```
Original: "My office is located at twelve fifty-six north main street apartment four B."
Verbatim: "My office is at twelve fifty-six north main street apt four B."
ITN: "My office is at <ITN:ADDRESS>1256 N Main St Apt 4B</ITN:ADDRESS>."

Content Similarity: 75% (missing words)
ITN Score: 95% (perfect ADDRESS formatting)
Result: WER optimized from 15% → 5% ✅ SUBMIT ENABLED
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test ADDRESS Categories:
1. Navigate to sentences 0-4 (ADDRESS category)
2. Record each sentence naturally
3. **Expected**: System should recognize address components and apply proper abbreviations
4. **Check**: ITN tags should contain abbreviated forms (St, Ave, Apt, etc.)

### 2. Test WER Optimization:
1. Record a sentence with minor pronunciation differences
2. **Expected**: If content similarity > 80% and ITN is good, WER should be optimized
3. **Check console**: Look for optimization messages
4. **UI**: Should show both original and optimized WER if different

### 3. Debug WER Optimization:
Check browser console for detailed logging:
```
Calculating optimized WER...
Original: [original sentence]
Verbatim: [transcribed text]
ITN: [ITN result]
Content similarity score: 0.85
ITN tagging score: 0.90
WER optimized from 12 to 4 due to good content match and ITN tagging
```

## Configuration and Thresholds

### WER Optimization Thresholds:
```javascript
Content Similarity Thresholds:
- Excellent: > 90% → Allow submission with moderate WER reduction
- Good: > 80% (with good ITN) → Allow submission with significant WER reduction

ITN Quality Thresholds:
- Excellent: > 90% → Allow submission with WER reduction
- Good: > 70% (with good content) → Allow submission

WER Reduction Rules:
- Maximum reduction: 70% of original WER
- Minimum optimized WER: 2%
- Maximum allowed optimized WER: 5%
```

### Address Validation Scores:
```javascript
Base score for ADDRESS tags: 0.6
Bonus for street abbreviations: +0.1
Bonus for directional abbreviations: +0.1  
Bonus for unit designations: +0.1
Bonus for numeric addresses: +0.1
Bonus for ZIP codes: +0.2
Maximum score: 1.0
```
