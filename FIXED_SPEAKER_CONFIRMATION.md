# Fixed: Speaker Information Confirmation Display

## Issue:
The "Speaker Information Confirmed" alert was showing prematurely before the user actually confirmed their speaker information.

## Solution Implemented:

### ✅ **Initial State Management:**
- **Hidden by Default**: Confirmed speaker info section is now hidden initially with `display: none !important`
- **Disabled Recording**: Recording section is disabled and grayed out until speaker info is confirmed
- **Clear Status**: Shows "Please fill in speaker information and confirm before recording"

### ✅ **CSS Improvements:**
```css
.hidden {
  display: none !important;
}
.disabled-section {
  opacity: 0.6;
  pointer-events: none;
}
.disabled-section .control-btn {
  cursor: not-allowed;
  opacity: 0.5;
}
```

### ✅ **JavaScript State Management:**
- **`initializeUI()`**: Properly sets initial state with confirmed info hidden
- **`disableRecordingControls()`**: Disables all recording buttons initially
- **`enableRecordingControls()`**: Enables recording only after confirmation
- **State Transitions**: Proper show/hide logic for form ↔ confirmed info

### ✅ **User Flow Now:**
1. **Initial Load**: 
   - Form is visible and enabled
   - "Speaker Information Confirmed" is hidden
   - Recording section is disabled and grayed out
   - Status: "Please fill in speaker information and confirm before recording"

2. **After Clicking "Confirm"**:
   - Form hides
   - "Speaker Information Confirmed" alert appears with speaker summary
   - Recording section becomes enabled and interactive
   - Status: "Speaker information confirmed. Select a sentence to start recording"

3. **After Clicking "Edit Information"**:
   - Confirmed info hides
   - Form reappears with previous values
   - Recording section becomes disabled again
   - Status: "Please update speaker information and confirm again"

### ✅ **Visual Feedback:**
- **Green Alert**: Only appears after actual confirmation
- **Disabled State**: Clear visual indication when recording is not available
- **Status Messages**: Clear guidance at each step
- **Button States**: Proper enable/disable states for all controls

The interface now properly enforces the workflow where users must confirm their speaker information before being able to record audio, preventing the premature display of the confirmation alert.
