# Transcription Empty Values Fix

## Problem
The transcription JSON files were being created with empty values:
```json
{
  "verbatim_transcription": "",
  "itn_transcription": ""
}
```

## Root Cause
The upload process was creating transcription JSON files with placeholder empty values, but there was no automatic mechanism to populate them with actual transcription data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Automatic Transcription During Upload ‚ö°
- **Modified the upload process** to automatically transcribe audio files during upload
- **Added real-time transcription** using Gemini AI after the audio files are uploaded to S3
- **Populates both verbatim and ITN transcriptions** immediately when files are uploaded

### 2. Batch Processing Endpoint üîÑ
- **Created `/api/batch-process-transcriptions`** endpoint to process existing files
- **Automatically detects** audio files with empty transcription data
- **Processes them in bulk** to fill in missing transcription information

## How It Works

### During Upload (New Files)
1. User uploads audio file via `/api/submit-medical-audio`
2. System uploads audio and metadata to S3
3. **NEW**: System automatically transcribes the audio using Gemini AI
4. **NEW**: System applies ITN (Inverse Text Normalization) formatting
5. System creates transcription JSON with actual data instead of empty values

### For Existing Files (Batch Processing)
1. Call `POST /api/batch-process-transcriptions`
2. System scans all audio files in `medical_audio_storage/audio/`
3. Identifies transcription files with empty or missing data
4. Processes each audio file through Gemini AI transcription
5. Updates corresponding transcription JSON files with real data

## Usage

### Test Batch Processing
```bash
# Run the test script
node test-batch-transcription.js
```

### Manual API Call
```javascript
// Call the batch processing endpoint
fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/batch-process-transcriptions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({})
})
```

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
```json
{
  "verbatim_transcription": "",
  "itn_transcription": ""
}
```

### After Fix:
```json
{
  "verbatim_transcription": "thinking more on the order of 5 million",
  "itn_transcription": "thinking more on the order of <ITN:NUM>5000000</ITN:NUM>"
}
```

## Key Behaviors

### Verbatim Transcription üìù
- **Contains the ORIGINAL, unmodified transcription** exactly as spoken
- **No number conversion** or formatting applied
- **Preserves all original speech patterns**, including numbers as digits
- Example: "I need 5 million dollars" stays as "I need 5 million dollars"

### ITN Transcription üîß
- **Contains the ITN-formatted version** with proper semantic labels
- **Numbers converted to words** for processing, then formatted with ITN tags
- **Addresses, phone numbers, dates, etc.** get appropriate ITN labels
- Example: "I need 5 million dollars" becomes "I need <ITN:NUM>5000000</ITN:NUM> dollars"

## Key Features
- ‚úÖ **Automatic transcription** for new uploads
- ‚úÖ **Batch processing** for existing files
- ‚úÖ **ITN formatting** with proper tagging
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** with fallback options
- ‚úÖ **Progress logging** for monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Language detection** from file naming convention

## Files Modified
- `route/route.js` - Added automatic transcription and batch processing endpoint
- `test-batch-transcription.js` - Test script for batch processing

## Environment Requirements
- Gemini API key must be configured (`GEMINI_API_KEY`)
- Audio files must be in the correct format and location
- Node.js server must be running for API endpoints
